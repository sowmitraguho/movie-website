Movie Browser Web App

This is a Next.js 16 + TypeScript web app for exploring movies. It uses Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI for styling and responsive components. Movie data is stored in a simple JSON file backend, and API routes handle fetching and adding movies. The project keeps components, pages, and data organized for easy maintenance. If I had more time, I’d add user login, search and filters, and a proper database for persistent data. During development, I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to quickly generate components, handle TypeScript types, and troubleshoot API and frontend issues.
